# React Native & Expo App
## Project Timeline

The project timeline is divided into key phases, each with specific objectives and an estimated duration. The total schedule is designed to be completed in approximately **8 weeks**, although the optimal timeline would be **16 weeks** to allow for structured and efficient development, meaning some features will be postponed.


### Phase 1: Research and Requirements Analysis (1 week)
- **Week 1**: 
  - Research available technologies.
  - Analysis of functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Study of similar cases and existing tools.
  - Definition of project objectives.
  - Creation of an initial prototype.


### Phase 2: Architecture Design and Prototyping (1 week)
- **Week 2**: 
  - Design of the overall application architecture (frontend, backend, database).
  - Creation of UML diagrams (use cases, class diagrams, etc.).
  - Development of wireframes or mockups of the main interfaces.
  - Validation of the design with potential users or mentors.


### Phase 3: Application Development (3 weeks)
- **Week 3**: 
  - Backend implementation:
    - Database configuration.
    - Implementation of authentication and RESTful APIs.
- **Week 4**: 
  - Frontend development:
    - Creation of main screens (home, competitions, teams, players).
    - Integration with the backend via APIs.
- **Week 5**: 
  - Implementation of advanced functionalities:
    - Automatic rankings.
    - Visualization of knockout brackets.
    - Statistics registration.


### Phase 4: Testing and Debugging (1 week)
- **Week 6**: 
  - Execution of unit and integration tests.
  - Identification and correction of critical errors.
  - Usability testing with real users.
  - Performance optimization and final adjustments.


### Phase 5: Documentation and Final Adjustments (2 weeks)
- **Week 7**: 
  - Writing technical documentation and the TFG (Final Degree Project).
  - Creation of the final report, including index, introduction, objectives, requirements, etc.
  - Review and correction of the final document.
- **Week 8**: 
  - Preparation of the oral presentation.
  - Submission of the complete project.
  - Presentation of the TFG to the evaluation panel.
