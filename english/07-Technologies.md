# React Native & Expo App
## Technologies
### 1. React Native

React Native is a multiplatform mobile app development framework developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) that allows us to build native applications for operating systems like iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, etc., using JavaScript and the declarative component paradigm (an extension of React, a library for web development).

Unlike other technologies, React Native compiles JavaScript code into native components, allowing our applications to maintain performance and user experience very similar to that of a 100% native app.

The reasons why we can consider React Native as the best or one of the best solutions are summarized as follows:

- **Efficiency in Multiplatform Development**, enabling the development of web, iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS applications from a single codebase. This significantly reduces the time and resources required.

- **Performance Close to Native Code**, although not as fast as native development, it has proven capable of delivering near-native performance in most scenarios.

- **Active Community and Robust Ecosystem**, it has a highly active global community of developers, ensuring a constant flow of libraries, tools, and open-source solutions.

- **Adaptability to New Technologies**, the tech world in 2025 will be dominated by innovations such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and 5G/6G connectivity. React Native, thanks to its flexibility and ability to interact with native APIs, is highly adaptable to these new technologies.

- **Enterprise Support and Widespread Adoption**, it has been adopted by numerous leading companies in various sectors, such as Meta, Shopify, Tesla, and Discord, demonstrating its viability for large-scale projects.

As a notable fact, as of 2023, **React Native is found in 6 out of 10 apps published** in app stores, while Flutter (its closest competitor) is found in 2 out of 10.

### 2. Expo

Expo is a framework built on top of React Native that represents a comprehensive and efficient solution for multiplatform mobile app development. Its zero-config approach, combined with a wide range of prebuilt APIs, advanced development tools, and cloud-based compilation services, makes it an ideal choice for teams looking to optimize time, resources, and the quality of the final product.

The reasons why Expo is worth considering for building our projects are summarized as follows:

- **Simplified Development Process**, one of Expo's main advantages is its ability to significantly reduce the learning curve and the time needed to start a project.

- **Wide Range of Prebuilt APIs**, it offers a complete ecosystem of preconfigured APIs that allow access to native device features, such as the camera, GPS, push notifications, local storage, and more, without the need to write native code.

- **Cloud Compilation and Simplified Distribution**, it offers next-generation cloud compilation services through its EAS Build platform, eliminating the need to install native tools like Xcode or Android Studio on the local machine.

- **Advanced Development Tools**, it includes advanced development tools that enhance productivity and the developer experience, such as **Expo Go**.

- **Compatibility with React Native Bare Workflow**, although designed to be a plug-and-play solution, it also offers compatibility with React Native's "bare" workflow, allowing direct access to native code.

- **Continuous Support and Regular Updates**, it has a dedicated team of developers and an active community that ensure regular updates and continuous support.

- **Competitive Cost-Benefit**, it can significantly reduce costs associated with mobile development, especially for small teams or projects with limited budgets.

### 3. Supabase
Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides a complete infrastructure for developing modern applications. Heavily inspired by Firebase, Supabase is built on robust technologies like PostgreSQL, offering a scalable relational database, integrated authentication, file storage, real-time functionalities, and automatic RESTful/GraphQL APIs.

Supabase's architecture is designed to be flexible, secure, and easy to integrate with any frontend application, making it an ideal solution for developers seeking a powerful backend without the need to manage servers or complex configurations. Additionally, its open-source nature allows developers to customize and extend the platform according to their specific needs.

The reasons why Supabase is worth considering for building our backend are summarized as follows:

- **Powerful Relational Database**, one of Supabase's main advantages is its use of PostgreSQL as the underlying database engine. PostgreSQL is one of the most advanced and reliable relational databases on the market, known for its performance, scalability, and support for advanced features like ACID transactions, custom indexes, advanced query functions, and extensions.

- **Integrated Authentication and Security**, it provides a ready-to-use authentication system that includes support for multiple login methods, such as email/password, OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), and JWT-based authentication. Supabase ensures that applications comply with the strictest security standards, legislation, and data protection, eliminating the need for custom implementations, reducing the risk of security errors, and speeding up development.

- **Automatic and Flexible APIs**, it automatically generates RESTful and GraphQL APIs based on the structure of the PostgreSQL database. This allows developers to easily and efficiently access and manipulate data from the frontend without manually writing controllers or endpoints.

- **Real-Time Functionalities**, it includes native support for real-time functionalities via WebSockets, enabling applications to receive instant updates from the database without periodic queries. This capability is essential for modern applications like chats, collaborative dashboards, online games, and real-time monitoring platforms.

- **File Storage and Processing**, it offers an integrated file storage system that allows uploading, downloading, and managing multimedia files (images, videos, documents, etc.) directly from the database. This system is compatible with cloud storage services like AWS S3, ensuring scalability and optimal performance.

- **Open Source and Active Community**, one of Supabase's most notable aspects is its open-source nature. Unlike proprietary solutions like Firebase, Supabase allows developers to inspect, modify, and extend the codebase according to their specific needs.

- **Scalability and Cost-Benefit**, it is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle increasing volumes of data and users without compromising performance. From an economic perspective, Supabase offers flexible free and paid plans, making it accessible for startups, small businesses, and personal projects. Additionally, by eliminating the need to manage servers or hire dedicated DevOps teams, Supabase significantly reduces operational costs associated with developing and maintaining a custom backend.
